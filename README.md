# Open Discussion Meeting Format

## Phase 1: Present Discussion Options

Ask a question, propose an answer, or propose changes to the rules. Got a project proposal? If multiple people seem interested in participating in multiple proposed discussions, propose a schedule.

Consider giving everyone a chance to participate here, for more and better opportunites to choose from. 

## Phase 2: Breakout Discussions

Go participate in whatever proposed activity most appeals to you. In pairs, or in groups. 

Recommendation: Let everyone follow their own interests, while you follow yours.

Suggestion: If proposing a schedule, consider adding in checkpoints. Consider scheduling a periodic request for new proposals or questions. Maybe every 15 or 30 minutes.
