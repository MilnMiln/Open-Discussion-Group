# Open Discussion Meeting Format

## Phase 0: Preparation (optional)

If you want to, think about what you'd like to do, acccomplish, or learn at the meeting. This might simply be to listen in on whatever seems interesting. Or perhaps you have a question.

## Phase 1: Present Discussion Options

Ask a question, propose an answer, or propose changes to the rules. Got a project proposal? If multiple people seem interested in participating in multiple proposed discussions, propose a schedule.

Consider giving everyone a chance to participate here, for more and better opportunites to choose from. 

## Phase 2: Breakout Discussions

Participate in or listen to whatever proposed activity most appeals to you. Expect both 1-on-1 and group discussions, debates, presentations, and/or Q&A.

## Recommendations and Suggestions: 

Let everyone follow their own interests, and expect them to allow you to follow yours.
