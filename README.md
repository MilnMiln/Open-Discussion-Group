# Open Discussion Meeting Format

## Phase 0: Preparation (optional)

Consider whether there is something you'd like to discuss, describe, or learn about at the meeting. This might simply be to listen in on whatever seems interesting.

## Phase 1: Present Discussion Options

Ask a question, propose an answer, or propose changes to the rules. Got a project proposal? If multiple people seem interested in participating in multiple proposed discussions, propose a schedule.

Consider giving everyone a chance to participate so that everyone gets more and better opportunites to choose from. 

## Phase 2: Breakout Discussions

Participate in or listen to whatever proposed activity most appeals to you. Expect both 1-on-1 and group discussions, debates, presentations, and/or Q&A.

## Recommendations and Suggestions: 

Let everyone follow their own interests, and expect them to allow you to follow yours.
